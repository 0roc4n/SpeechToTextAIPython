# SpeechToTextAIPython

Siri? Google? No.. it
This is your Jarvis or Friday AI.

Hi guys, this is my Speech to text AI.
the AI can listen to you and respond from your queries.
it made possible using openai as its response.

so basically the idea is that open ai is text generated ai which user are required to type in their
queries and the AI will generate the reponse as text also, but using python libraries the text generated ai is now can be implemented using speech to text approach. 
the user are now using their voice for passing queries to the ai and the response also are in speech generated. However, it still have the text generation part for some users are asking in mathematical queries so the AI can still show the users whenever the mathematical process to get the right answer based from their queries.

NOTE: The response of the AI is not always accurate, you can verify it also. Don't rely 100% from the AI generation. Also the data set of the AI suppports only 2021 information which means it does not know current events.
